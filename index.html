      <h1>Abstract</h1><hr/>
      <p>In our project, we worked on physically-based rendering of hair by implementing the Kajiya-Kay and Marschner models of hair as BSDFs in the Mitsuba renderer. To a lesser extent we also experimented with a thin dielectric model. Kajiya-Kay’s model assumes that light diffracts in a cone around the hair fiber, which causes the primary specular component to fall off more gently in the direction of reflection. With the thin dielectric model, the effects of multiple reflections inside the hair fiber create a secondary halo effect which renders hair more realistically. Finally, we implemented the Marschner model which considers three scattering modes: reflect (R), transmit-transmit (TT), and transmit-reflect-transmit (TRT). The Marschner model also considers other elements of the hair geometry such as angled scales which shift the specular highlights, and absorption within the fiber. We implemented these three models with decent rendering results and compared the differences between them.</p>
  
      <h1>Kajiya-Kay Model</h1><hr/>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="align-self-center col-12 col-md-8">
          <span class="align-middle">The basic idea of the Kajiya-Kay model is that light will reflect in a cone shape given by the mirrored vector rotated around the hair tangent which runs along the fiber from root to tip.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="text-center col-6 col-md-4">
          <img style="width:60%;" src="images/kk_diagram.png">
        </div>  
      </div>
      <p>Kajiya-Kay’s model modifies the Phong specular term to only depend on the angle to the hair fiber and uses the following equation:</p>
      <p class="text-center">$$\begin{align} \Psi_{specular} &= k_s cos^p(\theta) - \theta ‘ \\ &= k_s (cos \theta cos \theta ‘ + sin \theta sin \theta ‘)^p \\ &= k_s(t \cdot l t \cdot e + sin(t, l) sin(t, e))^p\end{align}$$</p>
  
      <p>The variables in this equation are illustrated in the diagram above. Most importantly, $t$ is the hair tangent, $e$ is the vector that points to the camera, $l$ is the vector that points to the light source, and theta/theta prime refers to the angles between these vectors and the tangent. $k_s$ is the specular term’s coefficient and $p$ is the Phong exponent that controls the power falloff with increasing angular difference.</p>
      <p>We implemented the specular term above, and made some improvements to improve perceived visual quality. Namely, we reduced the $k_s$ coefficient to account for the diffraction around all directions of the cone and ensure there isn’t too much light in the scene. We also pruned backscatter rays (where $w_i \cdot w_o > 0$ in the local shading frame) since the reflection should only go one way.</p>
      <p>These are our final results. The Phong model (included with Mitsuba) is included for comparison:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="text-center col-6 col-md-6">
          <p><b>Phong Model</b><br></p>

          <img style="width:55%" src="images/kk.png">
        </div>  
      </div>
      <p>The results obviously look very similar, since they are based on a similar principle. However, with our version of Kajiya-Kay, the end result has a more vivid color, softer highlights overall, while still retaining the diffraction pattern that extends down the hair fibers. The specular term also falls off much more quickly with viewing angle and this is probably due to the new alpha term.</p>
      <p>We can render the specular term separately in order to see how the highlights behave:</p>

      <h1>Thin Dielectric Model</h1><hr/>
      <p>The Marschner paper begins with the assumption that hair is a thin dielectric cylinder, and so we tried modeling with that first to see the difference. Using the thin dielectric model, we end up with a secondary halo due to transmitted and reflected terms. </p>
      <p>The thin dielectric model is similar to the glass model that we implemented in class. With probability R, R being the Fresnel term, light reflects. Otherwise, it refracts. Reflectance is the same as what we do in class with the resulting vector being Vector(-wi.x, -wi.y, wi.z), whereas for transmittance, it is simply Vector(-wi.x, -wi.y, -wi.z).</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the result does not look realistic since it is essentially thin strands of glass. However, you do begin to see the secondary halo caused by the additional transmittance interactions. The rendered result has no color because it does not have the diffuse term.</p>

      <h1>Marschner Model</h1><hr/>
      <p>The Marschner model incorporates three primary scattering modes: reflectance (R), transmit-transmit (TT), and transmit-reflect-transmit (TRT). It models the hair as a thin dielectric cylinder, incorporates the fact that hair is covered by scales that angle towards the hair root, and derives custom scattering functions based on the three modes of interaction as shown below:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="text-center col-6 col-md-6">
          <img style="width:62%" src="images/mm_left.png">  
        </div>
        <div class="text-center col-6 col-md-6">
          <img style="width:62%" src="images/mm_right.png">
        </div>  
      </div>
      <p>In addition to these terms, we added a diffuse term based on the microfacet model in order to add color. In terms of sampling, we looked for importance sampling of the Marschner model and found many results, but ultimately decided to stick with cosine hemisphere sampling. </p>
      <p>We implemented the Marschner model, focusing on the following function from the paper for the three components:</p>
      <p class="text-center">$$\begin{align} S(\phi_i, \theta_i; \phi_r, \theta_r) &= M_R(theta_h) N_R(\eta’ (\eta, \theta_d); \phi) / cos^2(\theta_d) + \\ &M_{TT}(\theta_h) N_{TT}(\eta’ (\eta, \theta_d); \phi) / cos^2 \theta_d + \\ & M_{TRT}(\theta_h) N_{TRT} (\eta’ (\eta * (\phi_h), theta_d); \phi) / cos^2 \theta_d \end{align}$$</p>
      <p>This is the scattering function given an input direction and output direction, which are both parametrized by the longitudinal angle $\theta$ along the hair fiber, and the azimuthal angle $\phi$ along the cross section. We see that it is broken up into terms for each of the three scattering modes and by each angle (M/N). We adapted the BSDF’s eval() function to calculate the $\phi$ and $\theta$ necessary to be passed into this function. </p>
      <p>$$\begin{align*} M_R(\theta_h) &= g(\Beta_R; \theta_h - \alpha_R) \\ M_TT(\theta_h) &= g(\Beta_TT; \theta_h - \alpha_TT) \\ M_TRT(\theta_h) &= g(\Beta_TRT; \theta_h - \alpha_TRT) \end{align*}$$</p>
      <p>The longitudinal scattering function is a gaussian parametrized with a variance of $\beta$, a constant given in the paper, and a mean of $\theta_h - \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is also a constant. $\theta_h$ is the expected angle that the ray would shoot outwardly if the hair were a perfect cylinder. Then, $\alpha$ represents the tilt of the hair scales resulting in the R term shifting towards the root and the TT and TRT terms shifting towards the tip. We end up messing with the coefficients for each model for aesthetic purposes. The final coefficients of alpha that we used were $m_R = 2, , m_{TT} = 1, m_{TRT} = 1$.</p>
      
      <div class="container-fluid text-center"><img style="width:55%" src="images/kk_left.png"></div>
      <p>The azimuthal function was much more difficult to compute. We ended up using the azimuthal function proposed in the d’Eon paper, which was much more computationally tractable.</p>
      
      <div class="container-fluid text-center"><img style="width:55%" src="images/mm_ray.png"></div>
      <p class="text-center">$$N_p(\fi) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 A(p, h)D_p(\phi - \Phi(p, h))dh$$ </p>
      <p>The azimuthal function varies for every ray, where each ray is labeled with $p$. $p$ is just 0, 1, or 2 which is labeled in the diagram of rays. $h$ can be seen in the original marschner diagram, and the $\Phi$, $D$ and $A$ function are calculated as follows.  </p>
      
      <p class="text-center">$$\Phi(p, h) = 2 p \gamma_t - 2 \gamma_i + p\pi$$ </p>
      <p>Where $\gamma_t = arcsin(h/\eta)$, $\eta$ being the index of refraction, and $\gamma_i = arcsin(h)$. These values can be seen in the original Marschner model. </p>
      <p class="text-center">$$D_p(\phi) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} g(\beta_p; \phi - 2 \pi k)$$</p>
      <p>In the code, we approximate $D_p$ by summing the Gaussians starting from the middle and expanding outwards. We start by summing the Gaussians at $k = 0$ and $k = -1$, then summing $k = 1$ and $k = -2$ and adding that to the sum, and so on until the change in the sum each iteration no longer exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
      <p class="text-center">$$A(p, h) = (1 - f)^2  f^{p - 1} T(\mu_a^’, h)^p$$</p>
      <p>Where $f$ is the fresnel term and $T(\mu_a, h)$ is the absorption function and $\mu_a$ is the absorption coefficient.</p>
      <p class="text-center">$$f = F(\eta, arccos(cos(\theta_d) cos(arcsin(h)))$$</p>
      <p class="text-center">$$T(\mu_a, h) = exp(-2 \mu_a (1 + cos(2 \gamma_t)))$$</p>
      <p>The exact integrand $N_p$ integrand is computationally expensive, so instead we use an approximation with the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, inspired by other BSDF implementations that we saw.  </p>
      <p class="text-center">$$\int_{-1}^1 f(x)dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i)$$</p>
      <p>For the approximation, we precompute a 64 by 64 grid of values corresponding to the azimuthal angle phi and cosine of half angle $cos(thetaD)$. During run time, we use bilinear interpolation for points in between points in the grid. This grid is also precomputed and thus uses very little computation during run time. This furthermore provides a degree of blurriness that the Marschener paper has stated will result in slightly more realistic rendering by smoothing out the light rays. </p>
      <p>An interesting observation we had was that the reason why Kajiya-Kay works so well is because it scatters the light similar to the reflectance component of the Marschner model, since by modeling the hair as having scales, it will reflect more in a cone shape. </p>

      <p>Here’s a render of the straight hair model with a side-by-side Phong model baseline:</p>
  
  
      <h1>Problems Encountered</h1><hr/>
      <p>The biggest challenge we faced was understanding exactly how Mitsuba worked. It was particularly hard figuring out how to compile the renderer and write a BSDF file since there was little documentation and online resources explaining it, making it unnecessarily difficult when learning how the renderer was actually interacting with its files. The most common way we fixed these issues were through trial and error, often resorting to print statements when we wanted to debug the code to understand what it was actually computing. </p>
      <p>The first major issue we encountered was finding a working version of Mitsuba that could compile for each of us consistently. In the first week of working, we had gone through a modifiable version of Mitsuba 2 (but was missing a Hair class) and an application-only version of Mitsuba 1. When we did find a modifiable version of Mitsuba 1 we could fork from, since our personal computers were split among MacOS and Linux, we often had build problems and had to find solutions to each of them. However, issues kept persisting, so we ended up building a version supported by Docker to resolve them.</p>
      <p>In our earlier attempts at Marschner BSDFs, we faced another major issue where we ran into many specs of light in the hair renderings that were too bright. </p>
      <img src="#.png">
  
      <p>This issue was mentioned in the Marschner paper as due to discontinuities in the mathematical model in the TRT component. In order to fix this issue, we turned off importance sampling and also increased the sampling rate. </p>
      <p>Some other smaller issues that popped up were invalid sample point errors, which we realized were caused by invalid PDF calculations when print debugging, and missing color in the image renderings which we realized were caused by missing diffuse components.</p>

      <h1>Team Member Contributions</h1>
      <p>Initially, the work was split up such that Briana and Yi figured out how the Mitsuba code base worked while Ja and Richard read the papers to understand the mathematical background more. Briana and Yi first implemented a simple Mirror BSDF, and then Ja implemented the Kajiya-Kay model. Briana then created the modified thin dielectric model while Yi and Richard started working on the Marschner model. In the middle, Briana’s OS updated and Ja created a Docker file that allowed everyone to work properly. Everyone worked together in order to finish implementing the initial Marschner model. Yi added the diffuse component to the Marschner model. Ja turned off importance sampling and increased sampling rate in order to fix our dotting issues.</p>
