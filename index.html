      <h1>Abstract</h1><hr/>
      <p>In our project, we worked on physically-based rendering of hair by implementing the Kajiya-Kay, thin dielectric, and Marschner models of hair as BSDFs in the Mitsuba renderer. Kajiya-Kay’s model assumes that light diffracts in a cone around the hair fiber, which causes the primary specular component to fall off more gently in the direction of reflection. With the thin dielectric model, the effects of multiple reflections inside the hair fiber create a secondary halo effect which renders hair more realistically. Finally, we implemented the Marschner model which considers three scattering modes: reflect (R), transmit-transmit (TT), and transmit-reflect-transmit (TRT). The Marschner model also considers other elements of the hair geometry such as angled scales which shift the specular highlights, and absorption within the fiber. We implemented these three models with decent rendering results and compared the differences between them.</p>
      
      <h1>Kajiya-Kay Model</h1><hr/>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
          The basic idea of the Kajiya-Kay model is that light will reflect in a cone shape given by the mirrored vector rotated around the hair tangent which runs along the fiber from root to tip.

      <p>Kajiya-Kay’s model modifies the Phong specular term to only depend on the angle to the hair fiber and uses the following equation:</p>
      <img src="#.png">
      <p>The variables in this equation are illustrated in the diagram above. Most importantly, t is the hair tangent, e is the vector that points to the camera, l is the vector that points to the light source, and theta/theta prime refers to the angles between these vectors and the tangent. K_s is the specular term’s coefficient and p is the Phong exponent that controls the power falloff with increasing angular difference.</p>
      <p>We implemented the specular term above, and made some improvements to improve perceived visual quality. Namely, we reduced the k_s coefficient to account for the diffraction around all directions of the cone and ensure there isn’t too much light in the scene. We also pruned backscatter rays (where dot(wi,wo) > 0 in the local frame) since the reflection should only go one way.</p>  
      <p>These are our final results. The Phong model (included with Mitsuba) is included for comparison:</p>

          Kajiya-Kay
          <img src="#.png">
        </div>  
      </div>
      <p>The end result has a more vivid color, softer highlights overall, and a diffraction pattern that extends down the hair fibers compared to Phong’s model. In comparison, the lighting in Phong’s model is much harsher.</p>

      <h1>Team Member Contributions</h1>
      <p>Initially, the work was split up such that Briana and Yi figured out how the Mistuba code base worked while Ja and Richard read the papers to understand the mathematical background more. Briana and Yi first implemented a simple Mirror BSDF, and then Ja implemented the Kajiya Kay model. Briana then created the modified thin dielectric model while Yi and Richard started working on the Marschner model. In the middle, Briana’s OS updated and Ja created a Docker file that allowed everyone to work properly. Everyone worked together in order to finish implementing the initial Marschner model. Yi added the diffuse component to the Marschner model. Ja went deep into the code base in order to turn off importance sampling and increase sampling rate in order to fix our dotting issues.</p>
